            <h1 class="article-title">The Pleasure of Blogging</h1>
            <p class="article-body"><h5> It took me several years and months researching different types of blogs to find
                out how to start a blog or how to be a successful blogger.<br><br>

                Every time I considered starting a blog, I kept thinking:<br><br>

                “What if no one reads it. What if I’m a terrible writer? What if no one cares what I am
                writing?”<br><br>

                <br>
                <img src="img/giphy.gif" alt="greenery pic" class="article-image">

                Well, eventually I decided: who the hell cares. I’m a passionate writer and I’m only going to get better
                at writing if I keep at it and keep practicing. I may never be a successful blogger but at least I am
                doing something that I am passionate about. And maybe one of my articles might help someone
                else.<br><br>


                I started writing to help find my niche, sometimes I feel like it has helped but sometimes I feel like
                I’m still lost and haven’t found that. But you know what? That is perfectly fine.<br><br>


                Why? I’m a young creative professional trying to make something out of my passion and what better way to
                show my knowledge than to write about it.<br><br>


                Along with my journey, I have figured out that blogging also helps me build my credibility. It gives my
                own business a voice and not only can people see the work I produce but through writing, they can get a
                sense of who I am.<br><br>


                So if you were like me considering starting a blog but not really sure if it’s a good idea? I would
                highly suggest you try it out because you will never know if it’s for you unless you try. That’s
                ultimately what I decided, try it out and maybe it will work out for the best…if not…well at least I
                enjoyed the ride.<br><br></h5>
