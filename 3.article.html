         <h1 class="article-title">a. Perfect For Rookies</h1>
         <p class="article-body">
         <h5> Determined to be simple, Python is actually very beginner-friendly. Its conciseness,
            expressiveness, and likeness to English, all contribute to its popularity as a choice for rookies. Its
            readability simply complements this. If you still haven’t made your mind, we suggest you take a look at our
            tutorial on Python Syntax to see what it’s like to be a Python person. Also, it is interpreted. Due to this,
            you aren’t stuck in your code until you reach the problem.</h5>
         </p>


         <h1 class="article-title">b. Community </h1><br><br>
         <p class="article-body">
         <h5>Like we’ve said earlier, Python has a large community which wants to see it grow continuously. Since it is
            open-source, people from the community are always at work trying to improve it.<br><br>

            A large community also means availability of a large number of libraries, modules, and packages to help you
            with your project. This, in turn, further contributes to the growth of the community.<br><br>

            To quote the statistics, Python has the:</h5><br><br>

         <h2>5th Largest StackOverflow Community</h2>

         <h5>If you’ve ever googled up a programming question, you’ve likely stumbled upon this website. It has 85.9k
            followers in its Python community, and around over 500k questions. These questions are also the third-most
            likely among other languages to be answered.</h5><br><br>

         <h2>4th Most-Used Language at GitHub</h2>

         <h5>GitHub is an extremely popular platform for version-control repository hosting service. It has over 950
            projects in Python with over 500 stars.</h5>

         <h2>3rd Largest Meetup Community</h2>

         <h5>An online social networking service aiding group meetings, Meetup.com has more than 1300 groups for Python,
            with a total of more than 608k members. This makes it its third largest community.</h5>
         <br></p>

         <h1 class="article-title">c. Career Opportunities </h1><br><br>
         <p class="article-body">
         <h5>Even though it is a very easy language to begin with, Python opens a lot of doors for you. In the
            professional world, Python and Ruby developers earn the second highest grub, next to Swift. In India, the
            average package of a Python developer with around 4 years of experience is approximately 5 lacs per annum.
            Python also finds use in cyber security. This is why Python is worth learning.<br><br></h5>

         <h1 class="article-title">d. Python in Web Development </h1><br><br>
         <p class="article-body">
         <h5>In our article on <a href="https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-introduction/"
               class="article-read-more">Introduction to Python</a>
            , we discussed several frameworks for Python. Many of these were
            meant for web development. These were Django, Pylons, web2py, and Flask. Of these, Django and Flask are
            quite impressive.<br><br>

            Giants like Instagram and Pinterest have made use of Django. Likewise, Flask is tiny, but highly
            customizable. Certainly, Python is a great scripting language.

         <h1 class="article-title">e. Python in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning </h1><br><br>
         <p class="article-body">
         <h5>In the same article, we also talked about frameworks like SciPy and NumPy for these purposes. In a time
            without Python, MATLAB would rule the AI & Machine Learningworld. But with Python, it is possible to carry
            out complex computations using a single import statement followed by a function call. Today, Python is
            preferred as the language for computer science research. With its speed and flexibility, it is here to stay.

         <p class="article-body">
         <h5>One of the most interesting parts of learning Python is Raspberry Pi. A microcomputer the size of a credit
            card, it is capable of a lot. With it, you can explore the word of technical DIYs (Do It Yourselfs). These
            include making robots, arcade machines, remote-controlled toys, and even cameras. And with Sonic Pi, you can
            even make music.

         <p class="article-body">
         <h5>Python is literally everywhere, be it a startup or a unicorn. From conciseness to capability, its perfect
            blend of uniqueness and flexibility make it a suitable choice for any project. It gets the best of both
            worlds. Giants like Google, Disney, and NASA are always on the lookout for talented Python professionals. I
            hope now you will not wonder why should you learn Python and start learning it.
